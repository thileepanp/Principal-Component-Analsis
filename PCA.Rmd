# UNDERSTANDING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (work reproduced from this webpage:https://goo.gl/Wgeieb)

Reading data

```{r}
data = read.csv('diamonds.csv')
```

Viewing all the variable names in the dataset

```{r}
colnames(data)
```

Taking only the numeric variables so we could use it in our analysis

```{r}
library(dplyr)
data_for_pca <- select(data, -X, -cut, -color, -clarity)
```

Installing the factominer package for PCA
```{r}
library(FactoMineR)
```

```{r}
pca = PCA(data_for_pca)
```
Here,the variables, 'price', 'carat', 'x', 'y', and 'z' form a composite variable called the Principal component 1 or Dim 1 which explains 68.06% of the variance in the data. Variable 'depth' explains 18.37% of the variance in the data along the second dimension. The variable 'table' is in the third dimension. 


```{r}
pca$eig
```
